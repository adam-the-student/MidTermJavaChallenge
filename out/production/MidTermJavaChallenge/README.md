# MidTermJavaChallenge

You have been provided with a Java coding assignment that requires you to process a dataset
consisting of approx. 1 million records. The data spans from 2001 to 2999, and it contains repeated
values (on average 1000 times). The data is primarily sorted in ascending order, but occasional
random noise disrupts this pattern, and noise ratio is once in 500 records. Your task is to efficiently
store the good data (ranging from 2000 to 2999) and separate out the noise into a different data
structure.
Your program needs to address the following questions:
1. Good data: Which value appears most frequently, and how many times does it repeat?
2. Good data: Which value appears least frequently, and how many times does it repeat?
3. Noise data: What is the highest value among the noise?
4. Noise data: What is the lowest value among the noise?
   Your code must be optimized for efficient memory usage and CPU utilization. This means ensuring
   that data is stored efficiently in data structures and minimizing the number of times data is processed
   for improved CPU efficiency
   I have attached three sample datasets for you to test your code. Each sample file is 5MB (!!)
   Basic rules :
1. This assignment is to be completed as a team, with four teams selected.
2. You are not allowed to seek assistance from individuals outside of your team to find the solution.
3. Usage of Chat-GPT or any other external resources to aid in finding the solution is prohibited.
4. Submit your final code to Coach Shaphy via email at shaphy@gmail.com or through Discord by
   June 24th, Saturday 11:59 pm
5. We will review your answers in the lab 12:00 pm next Sunday
